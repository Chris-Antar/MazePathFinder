# MazePathFinder
Description:
-	This project utilizes Java to design an algorithm with the ability to navigate through any maze using Breadth-First Search and Depth-First-Search.
- It additionally optimized navigation using Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm to find shortest paths between nodes in the maze to lead to shorter run times of the program.

Below are examples of each of the three algorithms being used.
